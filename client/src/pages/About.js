					This app is an opportunity for you to record your growth and the
					skills you pick up so that when you create your CV/resume and start
					applying for jobs, you can see how far you have come and what you have
					achieved, with examples. You will be building an experience map for
					yourself. You will do this by reflecting on what you have done over
					the week, talking about what you have achieved, and what you have
					found difficult.<br></br>
					<p>
						A lot of work you will accomplish will get forgotten as time has
						passed you will find it difficult to remember the skills you picked
						up along the way.

					This app ensures that does not happen. You can track what you have

						Do not forget any invisible work, i.e extra hours spent on learning
